###Week 03 - Trigonometry

####Check out:

[The Nature of Code - Oscillation chapter](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-3-oscillation/) by Daniel Shiffman – *It is much more advanced than where we are now because Shiffman chooses to teach forces before trigonometry... Don't worry if you can't understand, we'll start forces next week.*

####Homework:

######Non Code:

a) Find a video of a wave. Be comprehensive about what a wave is: ocean waves, sound waves, pendulums, anything. Draw a graph of the wave that you see in the video.

######Code:

a) Beautiful Harmony

Code a sketch with more than one element that oscillates in and out of harmony. Make something beautiful.

b) Look at me

Use atan to make a pattern of things that change according to the position of the mouse. Think rotation, but also color, size and any other parameters.

c) It's alive!

Code something that looks like it is alive. Maybe it is the way it moves... maybe it breathes. Maybe it has a heartbeat. Maybe it shivers. Be creative.
