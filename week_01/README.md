####Homework:

######Non Code:

a) Download and try to build the web version of ofBook. Materials and instructions are available at: [https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/)

b) Listen to music and dance. Dance smoothly, as if you were trying to imitate a ballet dancer. Then dance quickly, as if you were in a club. Pay attention to your movement, where it starts, where it stops, where it picks up speed and where it slows down. Do this for at least 5 minutes.

######Code:
*These exercises are pulled out from the 1st week of [Zach Lieberman's Algorithmic Animation class](), held at Parsons MFA D+T in 2012.*

a) Click to change Point A and Point B

Make an application where whenever you click, you change either the point A position or the point B position to the mouse position, alternating every time you click.

b) Interpolate something else besides position

Make the interpolation code control another property of an object, such as its size or color. Make the nicest composition that you can. Try to make it elegant and organic.

c) Multiple xenos

Make a series of xeno objects which follow the mouse, each at different rates. Give them slightly different colors so that you can perceive them as independent objects. The colors should be defined within the customCircle class.

Bonus homework - More advanced, but take a shot!

d) Multiple xenos trail

If you are really feeling like showing off, make an array of xeno objects where the first element follows the mouse, the second element follows the first, the third follows the second, etc.
