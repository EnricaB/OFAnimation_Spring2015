####Homework:

######Non Code:

a) Choose 3 different objects or systems. Apply a force to each one of them. Write a short paragraph about each object describing the nature of the resulting movement with maximum detail.

######Code:

a) Throw me around

Code a throwing mover. That is, if you press your mouse, move it quickly in a direction, it should appear with that throw initial velocity. You may find functions *ofGetPreviousMouseX()* and *ofGetPreviousMouseY()* useful in this.

b) We're very competitive and we all hate each other

Code a system in which the movers were attracted to the mouse but repel from each other. Try to make it pretty.
