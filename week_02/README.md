###Week 02 - Shapes / Randomness / Trigonometry

The exercises Random Walker and Gaussian are inspired by Daniel Shiffman's Nature of Code.

####Homework:

######Non Code:

a) Set up your homework github repo and send me the link to it. Instructions for this are in the syllabus.

b) Make a video of something that looks like it moves in an unpredictable way. It can be anything.

c) Come up with a physical way of drawing sine waves. There are good hints on how to do it in the gifs link.

######Code:

a) Click to change Point A and Point B

Make an application where whenever you click, you change either the point A position or the point B position to the mouse position, alternating every time you click.

b) Interpolate something else besides position

Make the interpolation code control another property of an object, such as its size or color. Make the nicest composition that you can. Try to make it elegant and organic.

c) Multiple xenos

Make a series of xeno objects which follow the mouse, each at different rates. Give them slightly different colors so that you can perceive them as independent objects. The colors should be defined within the customCircle class.

Bonus homework - More advanced, but take a shot!

d) Multiple xenos trail

If you are really feeling like showing off, make an array of xeno objects where the first element follows the mouse, the second element follows the first, the third follows the second, etc.
