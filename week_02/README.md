####Homework:

######Non Code:

a) Set up your homework github repo and send me the link to it. Instructions for this are in the syllabus.

b) Make a video of something that looks like it moves in an unpredictable way. It can be anything.

######Code:

a) Random drawing tool

Make a drawing tool that can be controlled by the mouse but has a degree of randomness applied to it.

b) Noise Landscape

Use noise to create a landscape. Be creative with the use of the word landscape.

c) Gaussian Population

Create a class to draw a character... Choose a characteristic that your average character has(size, color, movement). Then choose a standard deviation and create 1000 characters using Gaussian distribution.
